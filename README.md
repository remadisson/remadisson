### Hi there 👋

<!--
**remadisson/remadisson** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

» I just started "Cuode", that (hopefully) is a nice idea to invest time </br>
» I'm also organziing @RainbowRed with a friend of mine. If you want to help, check it out! <br>
» I'm always learning new things, I just started JavaScript and it's fun (I hope i wont regret this..)</br>
» Fun fact: My english is not the yellow from the egg. (🤣 sorry)</br>
</br>
Here is one side project of mine: </br>
