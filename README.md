<!--### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Â» I just started "Cuode", that (hopefully) is a nice idea to invest time </br>
Â» I'm also organizing @rainbow-red (https://www.rainbow.red/) with a friend of mine. If you want to help, check it out! <br>
Â» I'm always learning new things, I just started JavaScript and it's fun (I hope i wont regret this..)</br>
Â» Fun fact: My english is not the yellow from the egg. (ðŸ¤£ sorry)</br>
</br>
Here is one side project of mine: </br>
